This finding informs you that a machine running Kali Linux is making API calls using credentials that belong to your AWS account\. Your credentials might be compromised\. Kali Linux is a popular penetration testing tool that security professionals use to identify weaknesses in EC2 instances that require patching\. Attackers also use this tool to find EC2 configuration weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to your AWS environment\.

### Finding description<a name="pentest2_description"></a>

**An API was invoked from a Parrot Security Linux EC2 instance\.**

This finding informs you that a machine running Parrot Security Linux is making API calls using credentials that belong to your AWS account\. Your credentials might be compromised\. Parrot Security Linux is a popular penetration testing tool that security professionals use to identify weaknesses in EC2 instances that require patching\.
